## Hi!üëã My name is Davi, I`m a Computer Science MSc student at Instituto Superior T√©cnico - ULisboa.

‚ö° I really enjoy solving complex problems and making a positive difference. I specialize in Machine Learning and AI, and I find Math and Statistics beautiful;

üî≠ Currently working on my MSc thesis on Counterfactual Fairness for Machine Learning Models, in collaboration with Fraunhfer AICOS.

üõ†Ô∏è Here are some reports on relevant previous coursework about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistics and Computing:
